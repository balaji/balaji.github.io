  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I loved board games, back in my days I never had the exposure, knowledge and financial support to explore more complex games - snake &amp; ladder and monopoly (called business game in my region) are the only games I remember.</p>

<p>I have a 4.5 year old daughter. She lives up to the stereotype that girls are more mature than boys in comparison. I’m waiting for her to get a bit more older so that we can play board games together. I have a few games in mind such as Settlers of Catan, D&amp;D, Chess. But I feel she is old enough to play Monopoly. I think it is a great way to introduce the concept of money, investment and financial risk management.</p>

<p>The other skills I want to introduce to my kids are:</p>

<h3 id="reading-books">reading books.</h3>

<p>She is less than 5 years old and can’t comprehend english properly, so I need to wait for a few more years, but for now, I should read it to her in her mother tongue at least - Tamil.</p>

<h3 id="learn-fine-arts-and-performing-arts">learn fine arts and performing arts.</h3>

<p>One or two dance forms, one or two musical instruments, painting/drawing/coloring or maybe something else that she is interested in. I’m not going to force her on this one, but usually, humans + art is natural. You don’t need to force a (wo)man to get interested in art - it is in our genes, as long as we figure out which specific art form we are interested in.</p>

<h3 id="playing-outdoor-games">playing outdoor games</h3>

<p>I already talked about indoor games (yet barely. Its a vast field - ranging from board games, puzzles, role playing, etc. and the elephant in the room - video games). We all know the merits of outdoor games - learning to play by the rules, sportsmanship, team spirit, being graceful in defeat, preparing and planning for success etc. For now, let her play the street games with her friends, she still has another 2 or 3 years to go to learn and master a good outdoor game.</p>

<h3 id="self-defence">self-defence</h3>

<p>This seems to be more and more essential these days, Karate seems to be the preferred weapon of choice (Judo/Boxing/Krav Maga/wrestling are other pop options), I’ll put this under art form/outdoor games and not as a separate category. See if she is interested in learning one of this skill and go from there.</p>

<h3 id="other-essentials">other ‘essentials’</h3>

<ul>
  <li>swimming</li>
  <li>riding bicycle</li>
  <li>one or two foreign languages other than Tamil and English. (Hindi of course)</li>
  <li>programming (I know that you can work on your left or right brain and not both, but I’d introduce her to programming sometime around 9-10 years anyway and see how it goes)</li>
  <li>cooking (not because she is a girl, but learning to cook the ‘exciting’ stuff such as cakes, desserts, international recipes. I wish I knew more items to cook.)</li>
</ul>

<p>As I write this down I make a vow to make sure that I don’t force her to pursue any of these which she is not interested in pursuing. Childhood should be fun, you don’t need to know <em>all</em> of these or even <em>any</em> of these to have an awesome childhood, at the same time I do realize that it is my responsibility to expose her to as many fun opportunities as possible - within my economic and geographical limitations. I’m excited about her future, it is going to be fun.</p>

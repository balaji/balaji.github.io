    <p>TL:DR; Personal post. Nothing worth reading.</p>

<p>I was late to motorcycling, but as a kid I used to love cycling. It felt like I was flying. I didn’t own a cycle until I was 10 or 11. But those days, we can rent a cycle for 1 hour for 1 rupee.</p>

<p>When I first rode a motorized vehicle, it was an old Bajaj vespa scooter and I was 16. The next year my brother bought a pulsar and the next year I bought a used Royal Enfield Bullet Standard 350. I loved the riding comfort, the beat and the style mainly. This started my tryst with motorcycling. My college was close to 16km away from my house and my house was 25km away from the city. So, I’m used to being in the bike more often than not.</p>

<p>Then I got a job and now my offices were either 30km south or 20km north. So the riding continued.</p>

<p>Then I got married and had a kid and then I had another kid. So my priorities were different. I sold my bullet, with a heavy heart I must add. I remember the day when the new owner came to collect the bullet and I never left my bedroom. I bought a commuter bike for married life - Hero Honda Hunk. Now that my life has settled into a rythm (more or less), my heart started to wander a bit. Call it midlife crisis, call it ‘answering my inner voice’ or just reawakening of my desire to ride - I bought a Royal Enfield Bullet Standard 500 (this one is with the new UCE engine, that is way better sans the charm of the old CI engine) and I joined a local motorcycling club with an intention to ride often and ride long.</p>

<p>Its been 4 months since I bought my <del>bike</del> bullet. I’ve already been to a places like Javadi hills, Yelagiri hills, Pondicherry, Mysore, Mahabalipuram.</p>

<h4 id="so-here-are-some-note-to-self-when-it-comes-to-riding"><strong>So, here are some <em>Note to Self</em> when it comes to riding.</strong></h4>
<p># Skills</p>

<p>Just like any other hobby - you need skill to drive the machine. To ensure that you control the bike and not the other way, to save yourself and others on the road. This is a costly hobby - right from the bike to riding gear to petrol to tools to travel expenses. You can’t pirate or borrow (atleast not everything). My initial learning was done the hard way - I made <strong>every</strong> mistake there is to make while riding a motorcycle - and luckily I survived and the knowledge of surviving an accident helps in anticipating another accident that will be similar to the one you had, but this will not equip you to handle another type of accident to which you are not prepared for. I’m relying on by peers’ knowledge as well as some excellent riding manuals.</p>

<h1 id="maintenance">Maintenance</h1>

<p>Invest in the tools. If you love program development - then buy the best computer and ergonomic equipments - keyword, mouse, table, chair, etc. Similarly, when it comes to riding - invest in the best motorcyle that would suit your personality, suit your riding posture and suit your intentions. Learn the art of maintaining the bike, take it part and put it back together. It is a harsh reality for every bullet owner and generally a good advise for every bike owner. oh BTW, fixing a bike in itself is an art form that may people pursue.</p>

<h1 id="what-it-means-to-ride">What it means to ride</h1>

<p>Its kind of an silly question actually. Its like asking a person ‘what it is to read a book or listen to a song or watch a movie or sew a dress’. The answer is the same. It makes me happy. It puts me in a zone that is close to meditation, in a mood that makes me feel like I’m flying without cluttered emotions. It puts me in touch with mother earth in all her glory. As a rider pointed out in his blog <a href="http://www.hoohoohoblin.com/">http://www.hoohoohoblin.com/</a></p>

<p><em>“Riding a motorcycle is a form of karma yoga.  Karma literally translated means “action.”  Many people have misinterpreted it as the law of cause and effect, but that is not accurate.  Though it is true that if you are truly connected to everything, and everything is connected to you, then that which you do to another person, you are also doing to yourself, because you are that, they are that, and that is all there is.  But this doesn’t mean you will be punished for doing bad things to other people, or that someone is keeping score and will even things up before you die.  Riding a motorcycle is a way to clear the mind, interact with physical reality, and feel connected to the world.  I like it.”</em></p>

<p>and thats all there is to it. I will ride as long as it is possible for me to.</p>

<h4 id="highlightsnotes-to-self">Highlights/Notes to self:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Chennai traffic is broken beyond repair.</li>
  <li>Tambaram to Singaperumal Koil is teeming with life, this region is to Chennai what North east is to India - ‘not worth knowing’. Now its the hotbed of land mafia and US return IT couples.</li>
  <li>Hotel Balaji bhavan after Mamandoor is of good quality - they give six different sides for Dosas.</li>
  <li>Riding on highway is as safe as riding on city.</li>
  <li>Madurai rocks.</li>
  <li>Paruthi paal (cotton seed milk) tastes like payasam.</li>
  <li>Meenakshi Amman temple has a good museum - 1000 pillared mandapam. Entry ticket is Rs.5, but go in even numbers because they won’t have Rs.5 change.</li>
  <li>Idiyappam with paya and kari dosai is a delight.</li>
  <li>All roads lead to Madurai.</li>
  <li>Since all roads lead to Madurai, it is easy to take the wrong road.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/madurai-konar-kadai.jpg" alt="Idiyappam with aattukkal paya in Simmakkal Konar kadai, Madurai." /></p>

<h5 class="center" id="idiyappam-with-aattukkal-paya-in-simmakkal-konar-kadai-madurai">Idiyappam with aattukkal paya in Simmakkal Konar kadai, Madurai.</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Tenkasi road is so so. Single lane, difficult to overtake and there are enough slow moving vehicles.</li>
  <li>Srivilliputhur and Rajapalayam are quite small towns.</li>
  <li>It is not a good idea for two 6ft tall persons to ride on the same bike.</li>
  <li>When you want to buy something on the road, buy.</li>
  <li>Small villages with its vast fields are very calming.</li>
  <li>Plan ahead, buy a gift for the wedding.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="center" id="senthil---abinaya-wedding-tenkasi-any-guesses-why-our-hands-are-tied-behind-the-back-no-gifts">Senthil - Abinaya wedding, Tenkasi. Any guesses why our hands are tied behind the back? (no gifts)</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Sengottai - Thenmala road to Kerala is enchanting, do it again.</li>
  <li>Kerala twisties are good fun.</li>
  <li>90% of cars I saw in Kerala are Maruti. 90% of those Maruti are Alto variants.</li>
  <li>90% of the bikes I saw in Kerala are Yamaha FZ variants.</li>
  <li>In Kerala they play kabaddi-like-football thing on the road, its like waiting for crackers to burst in Deepavali, you need to stop and wait for the person to kick the ball and then go.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/somewhere-after-thenmala.jpg" alt="Somewhere after Thenmala (South mountain, not honey mountain)." /></p>

<h5 class="center" id="somewhere-after-thenmala-means-southern-mountain-not-honey-mountain">Somewhere after Thenmala (means Southern mountain, not honey mountain).</h5>

<ul>
  <li>It is natural in Kerala to block passengers on road for funds collection.</li>
  <li>People protest on the road all of the time, even on the eve of Onam.</li>
  <li>Kerala twisties are good fun, but once the night sets in, the roads can get a bit scary.</li>
  <li>Google maps knows the shortest path, even if it is a deserted residential battered narrow haunting road.</li>
  <li>If there is a google maps fan club, count me in.</li>
  <li>If a caption in a hotel says ‘never tip our waiters, its insulting their service’, expect the waiter to stand next to you until you tip.</li>
  <li>Night ride is fun - far less traffic and no scorching sun - provided you have enough mojo to last for the ride.</li>
  <li>Fast moving cars on night rides mostly come in pairs - this was interesting.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/couple.jpg" alt="Wife asked me to send the photo of the couple." /></p>

<h5 class="center" id="wife-asked-me-to-send-the-photo-of-the-couple">Wife asked me to send the photo of the couple.</h5>

<ul>
  <li>There are windmills in Tirunelveli and Thootukudi for a reason, it gets extremely windy as they are situated on the foothills of the western ghats. If you are in two wheeler, expect one hell of a ride.</li>
  <li>Since all roads lead to Madurai, it is easy to take the wrong road - more so at night and screw up your plans.</li>
  <li>Never ask for directions to a drunken old man at 1 AM.</li>
  <li>Dindugul - Trichy highway is as good as it can be, but expect shockingly battered roads as you reach Trichy.</li>
  <li>Besant Nagar to Velankanni pilgrims walk at night to cover the distance without sun. For some reason they go via Dindugul.</li>
  <li>It is better to ride through a city at 4 AM than at 9 AM.</li>
  <li>Petrol bunks on highways are night oases, you’ll know its true worth when you have bowel pressure.</li>
  <li>Toll booths at night are the best places to find snacks and open bathrooms.</li>
  <li>When you ride from 3 PM to 6 AM the next day and doze off on the bike, give up and get some sleep.</li>
  <li>Despite our best intentions shit happens. Watch out for a calf to walk into the road from the median and get hit by a car. Thank your stars that it was not you in your bike. (The calf survived, the car was damaged quite badly.)</li>
  <li>Chennai traffic is broken beyond repair.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="regrets">Regrets:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Didn’t stop in Ponmudi/Colachel/Kanyakumari.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Because I had to be in Chennai on Saturday and that meant that I needed enough rest, staying in Ponmudi or Kanyakumari on Thursday night would’ve left me riding on Friday daytime to reach Chennai by night and immediately travel the next day.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I was slightly uneasy to spend money in Ponmudi, its a hill station and a stay would’ve been costly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>I really wanted to do a night ride.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Didn’t experience the presence of gigantic windmills from Nagercoil to Tirunelveli as I was doing a night ride.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Didn’t buy Srivilliputhur paalkova. It is one of the lasting images of my childhood. Dad would buy this when he used to come from work on weekends to our home in Virudhunagar. It used to be a single block of quarter kg sweet. Me and my brother will cut it in the middle and finish it in one sitting! Fun times.</li>

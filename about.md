Lambda Don Raja is a (partial) anagram of my name `Balaji Damodaran`. I specifically like this one because it contains two of my favourite things:

1. Lambda (λ) - the 11th Greek letter. For a software engineer, `lambda` refers to lambda functions, which derives its name from [Lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) - the foundation for functional programming.

2. Don Raja - The song from the Dancehall-Bhangra star [Apache Indian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Indian)'s greatest album [No Reservations](https://open.spotify.com/album/6mVgdxshOzKoulrupVh9JA). He was my first childhood rock star. My first ever music album will be [Nuff Vibes EP](https://www.amazon.com/Nuff-Vibes-EP-Apache-Indian/dp/B01K8RI78G) for ₹45 in Amma Stores, 5th Stop, Thirunagar, Madurai.

The anagram misses `I` and `N`, the last letters of my first and last name, if only Superstar [Rajinikanth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinikanth) was called Rajani and not Rajini ;)

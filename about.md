Lambda Don Raja is a (partial) anagram of `Balaji Damodaran`. I specifically like this one because it contains two of my favourite things:

1. Lambda (Î») - the 11th Greek letter. For a software engineer, `lambda` refers to lambda functions, which derives its name from [Lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) - A formal system for expressing computation. It is the foundation for functional programming.

2. Don Raja - The song from Apache Indian's album [No Reservations](https://open.spotify.com/album/6mVgdxshOzKoulrupVh9JA). Apache Indian was my first rock star as a kid growing up in the outskrits of Madurai, India.

The anagram misses `I` and `N`, the last letters of my first and last name, if only Superstar [Rajinikanth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajinikanth) was called Rajani and not Rajini ;)

You most likely found this website because your name is also Balaji. If you are, a warm welcome to you my namesake. The name that puts us in the demographic of a male, South Indian, born between late 1970s to late 1980s, Vishnu devotee parents, career in IT - was indeed once a 'modern' name. It does appear that there are hundreds of thousands of us, isn't it? If you were born earlier, way to go sir! your parents were trailblazers. My sympathies if you were born later - but take heart that all the Rians, Rihans and Rivans of today will meet the same fate.

Sorry the domain is not for sale.

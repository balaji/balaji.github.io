I am Balaji Damodaran. There are <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/Balaji" target="_blank">many</a> of us. This is my blog.

I was the "shy type", "the quite one" in school. I was the "he doesn't speak much, a very calm and obedient person" in my extended family. I was the "Bodhai" (trans: _junkie_) in college. I was the "cool one", "non-confrontational", "doesn't get flustered" at work. I convinced myself that I was an "introvert".

It turns out I might have a few psychiatric disorders afterall. The clues were always there. My constant leg shaking and foot tapping when I sit in public. My seemingly high empathy but low sympathy. My inability to hold unwavering attention during a forty minute presentation/lecture. When we actually went looking for the symptoms to diagnose a family member, I was ticking all the boxes.

So, will I get an official diagnosis? Maybe not, I hacked my way to midlife. It is all downhill from here anyways.

Here is my resume:

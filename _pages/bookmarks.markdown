- `[29/Nov/24]` [Poor Charlie's Almanack](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack):
The "[Stripe mode](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack)" of this book is something I have never seen before for a book. The pictures, quotes, sections are well designed and it _makes_ you want to read the book. The book itself is a treasure. Don't miss the recommended reading and the "[Berkshire Mode](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack/book)".

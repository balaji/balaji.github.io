### Books
#### [Poor Charlie's Almanack](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack) `29/Nov/24`
The "[Stripe mode](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack)" of this book is something I have never seen before for a book. The pictures, quotes, sections are well designed and it _makes_ you want to read the book. The book itself is a treasure. Don't miss the recommended reading and the "[Berkshire Mode](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack/book)".

#### [Blue Box](https://www.viz.com/blue-box) `01/Jan/25`
Blue Box is a manga. A high-school romance drama with a sports backdrop. It has likeable characters, an uplifting & moving story that is on equal parts emotional, romantic, tragic, heart-felt and motivational with a unique art style. I got hooked when I started watching it in Netflix with my daughters. Then I wanted more and continued with the manga. It would take several seasons to catch up with manga, I want to know what happened to them.

### Movies
#### [Kamal Haasan's 70 favourite Indian movies](https://web.archive.org/web/20240805130423/https://www.hindustantimes.com/interactives/kamal-hassan-70-movies/#expand) `30/Dec/24`
On 70th Indian Independence Day celebrations, [Hindustan Times](https://hindustantimes.com) requested [Kamal Haasan](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal_Haasan) (big fan) to curate a list of his favourite 70 Indian films and why (obviously the list is limited to movies released till 2017). The article is lost probably in a website rewrite but wayback machine to the rescue. If wayback machine fails, here is my local copy sans images: [Kamal's 70 favourite Indian Movies](/kamal-70-films).

### Books
- `[29/Nov/24]` [Poor Charlie's Almanack](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack):<br>
The "[Stripe mode](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack)" of this book is something I have never seen before for a book. The pictures, quotes, sections are well designed and it _makes_ you want to read the book. The book itself is a treasure. Don't miss the recommended reading and the "[Berkshire Mode](https://www.stripe.press/poor-charlies-almanack/book)".

### Movies
- `[30/Dec/24]` [Kamal Haasan's 70 favourite Indian movies](https://web.archive.org/web/20240805130423/https://www.hindustantimes.com/interactives/kamal-hassan-70-movies/#expand):<br>
On 70th Indian Independence Day celebrations, [Hindustan Times](https://hindustantimes.com) requested [Kamal Haasan](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal_Haasan) (big fan) to curate a list of his favourite 70 Indian films and why (obviously the list is limited to movies released till 2017). The article is lost probably in a website rewrite but wayback machine to the rescue. If wayback machine fails, here is my local copy sans images: [Kamal's 70 favourite Indian Movies](/kamal-70-films).

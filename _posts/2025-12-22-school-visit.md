  Through an Alumni meet, I got the opportunity to visit the school I studied classes 11 and 12. It was a feeling of acceptance more than anything else. I felt like "Yes, I was here. I went through these incidents in my life. Now here I am." I was surprised with what I wasn't feeling - pride, joy, pain, fellowship, regret, longing. Probably because I only spent 2 years in that school and I didn't meet MY teachers.

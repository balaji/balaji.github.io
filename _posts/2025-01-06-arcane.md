  <a href="https://www.arcane.com/en-gb/">Arcane</a><br>This could've been a just-another-fantasy series. But the production quality, voice acting, animation, background music and world detail are so phenomenal that it makes the 2-season TV series one of the best ever in its category. The "elevation scenes" (action sequences, protagonist/antagonist introductions) are too good, goosebumps guaranteed. Indian commercial movies that rely on elevation should take note, this is how it is done.

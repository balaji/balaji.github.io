  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240805130423/https://www.hindustantimes.com/interactives/kamal-hassan-70-movies/#expand">Kamal Haasan's 70 favourite Indian movies</a><br>On 70th Indian Independence Day celebrations, Hindustan Times requested Kamal Haasan (big fan) to curate a list of his favourite 70 Indian films and why. For obvious reasons, the list is limited to movies released till 2017.<br>The article is lost probably in a website rewrite but wayback machine to the rescue. If wayback machine fails here is my <a href="/kamal-70-films">local copy</a> sans images.

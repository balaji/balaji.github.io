  Watched Sinners in a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Chennai. My only regret: I should've watched it in a big screen with theatrical sound system. The movie is open to interpretation. It has soul. I interpreted the vampire confrontation as a racist incident, in which the racists and a lot of common folk die. The KKK comes for revenge and our protagonist has the final say in a one-man Commando-style showdown. There are also themes of immortality, music, freedom and black history. The music was amazing. A terrific watch. Of the limited films I watched in 2025, this one is up there at the top.<br>There are at least 3 standalone movies packed in one, which appears to be the movie's main criticism, but I am happy with this version and with my interpretation.

  Watched Sinners in a flight from Frankfurt to Chennai. I should've watched it in a big screen with theatrical sound system. It has soul. I interpreted the vampire confrontation as an IRL incident, in which racists cause death and destruction. The community fights back, KKK comes for revenge and the protagonist has the final say in a one-man Commando-style showdown. The music was amazing. A terrific watch. Of the limited films I watched in 2025, this one is up there at the top.<br>There are at least 3 standalone movies packed in one, which appears to be the movie's main criticism, but I am happy with this version and with my interpretation.

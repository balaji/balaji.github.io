  New bookmark: <a href="/bookmarks#blue-box-01jan25">Bluebox</a><br><br>The first manga I read was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(manga)">Akira</a> 15 or so years ago. I read it only because the movie adaptation was in an IMDb list. I "properly" entered the world of manga when my kids were old enough to watch anime. One-Punch Man, Demon Slayer, One Piece are some of my favourites. Blue Box is certainly entertaining.

  <a href="https://www.viz.com/blue-box">Bluebox</a><br>The first manga I read was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(manga)">Akira</a> 15 or so years ago. I read it only because the movie adaptation was in an IMDb list. I "properly" entered the world of manga when my kids were old enough to watch anime. One-Punch Man, Demon Slayer, One Piece are some of my favourites.<br>Blue Box is a high-school romance drama with a sports backdrop. It has likeable characters, an uplifting & moving story that is on equal parts emotional, romantic, tragic, heart-felt and motivational with a unique art style. I got hooked when I started watching it on Netflix with my daughters. Then I wanted more and continued with the manga. It would take several seasons to catch up with manga, I want to know what happened to them.

  A Real Pain is the first time I watched Kieran Culkin for full 30+ minutes on screen. What a terrific performance! I felt his every facial muscle movement. His eyes when he is alone vs when is with company. I saw his world shatter when he heard his grandma talked about him behind his back - a behaviour which he disapproves of. Jesse was amazing too. Themes about survival, depression, pain and suffering - so poignantly depicted and left to the audience to "feel" them rather than get preached about like its done on most Indian movies. I watched with my daughter and it was a memorable one.

I look forward to December for 2 specific things.

1. Spotify Wrapped
2. Advent of Code (I will write about this in another post).

## Top 0.05%

So, I am apparently amongst the top 0.05% of listeners of Ilayaraaja. I am happy. But this surely this means that I am at least amongst the top 100. Because it looks like I have listened to 3373 minutes till November (may be even a week earlier) - So thats like 10 minutes per day every day. A die-hard fan can do better than this. So if _this_ effort is top 0.05%, then I'm pretty sure I am in the top 100 if not top 10 listeners of Ilayaraaja in Spotify. So thats cool.

Got lucky on the top artists list as well - this is exactly how I would have wished my top 5 artists to be this year. As you can see, this year I went all in on Tamil film music. I am happy that A.R. Rahman and Anirudh are there as well. If there are few more slots, I'd choose Yuvan Shankar Raja and Santhosh Narayanan as the next 2 top artists.

And this is my "all inclusive" playlist of Ilayaraaja - it has close to 700 memorable hits - some songs are geo-locked (and yes, my profile name is IlayaraajaFan)

## Bottomline

![Summary](/assets/img/4.jpg)
<p align = "center"><i>Summary</i></p>

My top songs are from Ponniyin Selvan -1. All of them (they had to choose only 5, otherwise my 6th top song will also be from PS-1). I listened on average 70 minutes of Spotify per day every day. This is the first year where my wrapped does not have songs listened to by my daughters. I don't know how to feel about this. On one hand, I had full control of my stats but on the other hand my kids aren't listening to music - which is important.

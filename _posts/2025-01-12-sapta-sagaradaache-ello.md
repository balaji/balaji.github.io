  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapta_Saagaradaache_Ello_%E2%80%93_Side_A">Sapta Sagaradaache Ello - Side A</a><br>I knew for a while that this was critically acclaimed movie. On my flight from Chennai to Stockholm I started watching it. The first 20 minutes was a breath of fresh air. The music and visuals were pleasing. I was rooting for the characters. But once I understood where the story was heading I couldn't bring myself to watch the rest of the movie. It was too close to reality, on a topic that was debated and enraged on social media to death. I had to force myself to watch it. Twice. After a while I got hooked to the story again and the love between them was depicted beautifully. The ending was poetic.

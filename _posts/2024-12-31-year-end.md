  2024 is coming to a close. Like every recent years, I start and end the year in Chennai. Workwise it wasn't great (though not a bad one). In a few months in my performance review I will know how bad it was. In other news, I turned 40 this year. The year I "found out" after years of f**king around, aka the year I got diagonsed as diabetic. I had my most number of travels for a year this year, which was cool. Didn't read/workout/socialize/talk/take the initiative/learn/play as much as I'd have liked to.<br><br>I'm hoping for a better 2025. I am especially looking forward to this journal journey

  The annual Chennai Book Fair is in its 48th edition. It is <i>the</i> place to be if one is interested in classic, modern and neo-modern Tamil literature and poetry books. The English language book collection is so so. For discovering English books one should be outside the fair with the long row of book vendors on the footpath creating traffic chaos and selling used books at a flat rate from â‚¹20 onwards. No new books for me this year. I am still taking in batches the unread books in my old room to Stockholm.<br><br>The best part of being in Chennai in Week 52/+1.

  2025 has been a blur. Personally and professionally it wasn't a good year. I am diabetic now, but not taking medication yet, it is borderline. Didn't really ship anything meaningful at work, I seem to find busy work to spend weeks on that somehow is complicated yet low impact. My exit plan didn't go well either. I got calls from dream companies but couldn't clear interviews. On the plus side, I completed one semester in OMSCS - <a href="https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7646-machine-learning-trading">Machine Learning for Trading</a>, more on that in another post.

  In 1997/98, on a randaom Sunday afternoon I was traveling from Chennai Broadway to Anna Nagar West on the city bus. I must've been 13 or 14 year old. A lazy lungi clad middle-aged man with an empty grocery bag boarded the bus. After a while he approached me and asked "is this the stop to Koyambedu?" (I would later find out that he was in the wrong bus). I had no clue but I nodded enthusiastically. He got down at Thirumangalam. As the bus left, I saw him looking around cluelessly trying to make sense of where he was. He was 1.5 km away from Koyambedu market.<br><br>I think about him sometimes.

  Matt Damon gave an <a href="https://youtu.be/Jf4hSjUNInU?si=tXSnGQ_ChxUxUxgb">interview</a> about winning the Oscar award as a 27 year old. He says what a wasted life it would be if someone is chasing this well into their 80s and getting it and realising that it wasn't worth it. That he was blessed to have this realisation in his 20s because he got the award that early.<br><br>This is a profound statement with two key takeaways for one's career:<br>1) Chasing job titles isn't worth it<br>2) Job titles come to you when you work hard and show results. The results part is important.<br>

This was a weekend project to know the likelihood of a specific IPL team reaching playoffs. IPL is [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League). A yearly T20 cricket tournament with 10 teams playing in a round-robin format. Some teams play each other twice. 4 teams qualify for playoffs based on the points.

## UI
- The top left "***Points table***" is  a 2D matrix of teams head to head. I used a lot of colours here.
  - *Biege* with a date is a match that is planned.
  - *Pastel Green* is a match that is completed and team on the horizontal row won.
  - *Pastel Red* is a match that is completed and the team on the horizontal row lost.
  - The clickable *Pink* button lets you predict a winner for a match in the future.
  - *Dark Green* with a date is a 'predicted' result where the team on the horizontal row wins.
  - *Dark Red* with a date is a 'predicted' result where the team on the horizontal row loses.
  - The *Reset* button at the bottom clears all predictions.
  - There is a points section at the end that is updated on each prediction.
- The top right "***My Predictions***" keeps track of one's predictions.
  - One can predict only one match at a time in the order it was scheduled.
  - There is a *rollback* button at the bottom to revert one prediction at a time.
- The bottom row is the ***most useful feature***. There are 3 "tables". All 3 have similar semantics.
  - The table gives the *probability* of a particular team finishing in a particular position.
    - The sum of all values in a row will be equal to 100.
  - The table is *sorted* by each team's "highest probable position in the table".
  - The first table is the current situation, the other 2 tables predicts "what would happen to the probabilities if Team A or Team B wins" respectively.
  - It is color coded to highlight the highest probability with a dark purple colour and taper down for each lower probabilities.

There was a lot to unpack in the UI (it read as a user manual) with lots of colours. I am quite proud of this UI, but I do wonder if this can be simplified in anyway.

## The Idea

The design is actually brute force, there is no ML or AI here. 

Lets take an example with 3 teams. A, B and C. 

The matches are:
1. A vs B
2. A vs C
3. B vs C

There are 8 possible outcomes with these 3 matches:

| Match 1  | Match 2  | Match 3 | A's win %| B's win % | C's win %| 
|---|---|---|---|---|
|A|A|B|100 `1` |50 `2` |0 `3`|
|A|A|C|100 `1` |0 `3` |50 `2` |
|A|C|B|50 `t` |50 `t` |50 `t` |
|A|C|C|50 `2`|0 `3`|100 `1`|
|B|A|B|50 `2`|100 `1`|0 `3`|
|B|A|C|50 `t`|50 `t`|50 `t`|
|B|C|B|0 `3`|100 `1`|50 `2`|
|B|C|C|0 `3`|50 `2`|100 `1`|

When you average "win %" across all possibilities, it will be 50% for ***each position in the results table***. But in the middle of the tournament this would've changed due to previous results - increasing the likelihood of the team that won more matches than the other. By this way we can "predict" the likelihood of which team will end up in which position.

## Design
- We will represent a state of past wins as a series of 1s and 0s. 
  - For example: `0110` would mean 4 completed matches. Team 2 won the 2nd & 3rd matches. Lost 1st & 4th.
- Let's maintain the probability state in a 2 x 2 matrix.
  - For example, this json means there are 3 teams, `(i, j)` represents $${(i + 1)}^{th}$$ team's $${(j + 1)}^{th}$$ position's probability.
    ```json
    [[75, 12.5 12.5],
     [16.67, 66.66, 16.67],
     [0, 33.33, 66.66]]
    ```
- We will store this in a database with key as match state (e.g. `0110`) and value as the probability state.
- Everything else is read-only UI.

### Implementation
This code provides the core function that calculates and stores results in database. It is a recursive function, where for each match, the function gets recursively called twice. 

The complexity of such a function is $$\theta(2^n)$$ where $$n$$ is the total number of matches to calculate.
```javascript
/**
 * Recursive function to generate match and positional probability states.
 * matchId: Sequential Integer, represents a match
 * points: Current points table as {team1: points, team2: points, ...}
 * str: match results string. e.g. 01101
 */
function predict(matchId, points, str) {
    // get team1 vs team2 details
    const match = matchResults[`${matchId}`];
    // calculates 2 outcomes. When Team A or Team B wins.
    const outcome1 = { ...points, [`${match.team1}`]: points[match.team1] + 2 };
    const outcome2 = { ...points, [`${match.team2}`]: points[match.team2] + 2 };
    // Exit condition for the recursive function: When we run out of matches.
    if (matchId === END) {
        const s1 = calculateState(outcome1);
        const s2 = calculateState(outcome2);
        writeDB(`${str}0\t${JSON.stringify(s1)}`);
        writeDB(`${str}1\t${JSON.stringify(s2)}`);             
        return average(s1, s2);
    }
    // recursively call the function for further outcomes
    const s1 = predict(matchId + 1, outcome1, `${str}0`);
    const s2 = predict(matchId + 1, outcome2, `${str}1`);
    // store intermediate results.
    writeDB(`${str}0\t${JSON.stringify(s1)}`);
    writeDB(`${str}1\t${JSON.stringify(s2)}`); 
    return average(s1, s2);
}
```

### Constraint #1: Storage
For 3 matches, the total number of possibilities was $$2^3 = 8$$ unique results. But we should also store intermediate results. Which results in

$$2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 = 14\,records$$

This is a mathematical induction equation, where

$$2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 +\, ...\,+\, 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 2$$

In 2022 IPL, there were 70 league matches. So the total number unique results at the start of the tournament is 

$$2^{71} - 2 = 2,361,183,241,434,822,606,846$$

As you can see, this is a very very large number of records. A Petabyte is $$2^{50}$$ bytes. Now, even if we assume 10Kb ($$10 * 2^{10}$$ bytes) for each record, we would require

$$\frac{2^{71} * 10 * 2^{10}}{2^{50}} = 10 * 2^{31}\, Petabytes$$

### Constraint #2: Compute
As explained above, we need to make $$2^{70}$$ calculations. Even though it is a one time effort, it is impossible to complete the calculations. Even if we assume that we can calculate **10,000 states in 1 millisecond**, the number of years it would take to complete this is close to 14.5 million years:

$$\frac{2^{72}}{1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 10000} = 14,974,525.88\,years$$

### Mitigation
So it is impossible to calculate position probability for all matches. The usefulness of the data is also not great because, after every match **half** the data in the database will become useless.

After a few more back of the envelope calculations, it turned out that calculating predictions when ***24 or less matches*** remain out of 70 is doable. This is what I did with the solution.

## Setup
- ***UI***: Single Page node.js app hosted on Github pages through `gh-pages` npm package.
- ***Database***: AWS Dynamo DB. AWS provides **25 GB** of always free storage in Dynamo DB.
- ***Backend***: HTTP endpoint of a AWS Lambda function with CORS support - returns a record from db.

## Mobile Compatibility
Nothing breakthrough here, but very proud of what I did to make this mobile friendly.
